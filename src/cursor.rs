// Cursor represents an iterator that can traverse over all key/value pairs in a bucket in sorted order.
// Cursors see nested buckets with value == nil.
// Cursors can be obtained from a transaction and are valid as long as the transaction is open.
//
// Keys and values returned from the cursor are only valid for the life of the transaction.
//
// Changing data while traversing with a cursor may cause it to be invalidated
// and return unexpected keys and/or values. You must reposition your cursor
// after mutating data.
